# .dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for macOS

## install

Run this command to install my dotfiles. Downloads and runs the `init.sh` script in this repo which kicks off the dotfiles setup.  This currently only supports macOS, will potentially add linxu support in the future.

```shell
curl -L https://dotfiles.wrc.dev | zsh
```
